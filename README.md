# Seasons Viewer

A simple JavaScript image viewer that allows the user to navigate throughout different seasons using the thumbnails of the botton of the main image

## How it works
- The project useas an array of objects to store the id of the image and the src
- When the user presses an image of the thumbnail, the main image changes. To do this the project uses a loop to iterate the different images
